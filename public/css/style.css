/* MIXINS
Think of mixins as a simplified version of constructor classes.  You can grab a whole group of CSS declarations and re-use it whenever you want to give and element a specific set of styles.

mixins can even accept arguments with the option to set default values.  Here is a square mixin, used to create squares of varying sizes and colors.*/
