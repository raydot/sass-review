Following the tutorial "Learn Sass in 15 minutes" located at https://tutorialzine.com/2016/01/learn-sass-in-15-minutes

## Conclusion
Good tutorial.  Very straightforward.  

Question: there must be a "node way" to not have to run css from scratch every time you use it, as suggested by [this setup tutorial](https://medium.com/@TheJesseLewis/start-using-sass-in-your-node-js-in-5-minutes-66978e490e4b).  So what is the replacement for always having to type:
`sass --watch scss/index.scss:public/css/style.css` (or whatever)
